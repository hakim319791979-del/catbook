# CatGram (Flutter)

Minimal Flutter skeleton for a cats social app. Builds APK via GitHub Actions.

## Build from iPhone
1. Open GitHub in Safari → create repo → add these files with the same paths.
2. Commit to `main`. Actions will auto-start.
3. Go to **Actions** → latest run → **Artifacts** → download `app-release-apk`.

## Run locally (optional)
Requires desktop. Not needed if you only want the APK from Actions.

## Roadmap
- Replace InMemoryBackend with Firebase or Supabase.
- Add media upload and auth.
- Add NFT badge per cat (contract + mint flow).
